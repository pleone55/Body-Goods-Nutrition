## About Project
Simple E-commerce website based off one of the nutrition store that I go to. Landing page shows the different categories available for the customer to view depending on their needs. Customer is able to sign in and authenticate sign in with Google using Firebase. Customer is able to view the collection preview of products provided, limiting 4 to each category on the shopping landing page. Implements Redux to allow the customer to add and delete items from the cart. Redux is used to hold the user in session until they hit the sign out link. Redux is also used to hold the items in the cart if the the customer were to refresh the page. Shopping cart icon updates in real time allowing customer to see their cart items with a dropdown before proceeding to checkout screen. Checkout implements the Stripe API (test mode) to allow the customer to "checkout" as soon as they finish shopping.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
